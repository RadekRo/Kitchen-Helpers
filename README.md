# Kitchen-Helpers


To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However, if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the step-by-step solution guide
Gordon Ramsay made up his mind, he wants to digitize his kitchen. So he's trusted you with the task of modeling Hell’s kitchen. Restaurants have cooks, one chef, and kitchen helpers.



Use UMLs to communicate your design.

Use nullable types (like: int?) to specify alternate values to return or alternate code.

Tasks

The attributes of each employee
Store the name, birth date, and salary of every employee.

Each of the listed attributes can be retrieved using getters.

Whenever an employee is printed, at least their name is displayed.

Every employee can print their own tax, which is the 99% of the salary.

There are three employee types, chefs, cooks and kitchen helpers.

CRITERIA
Cooking
Chefs and cooks can cook.

Chefs are either shouting or requesting ingredients.

Cooks always shout back that they are cooking. (So that the chef will leave them be.)


Helpers and ingredients
Kitchen helpers have ingredients.

The ingredients are the following.

meat
potato
carrot
Helpers have a random number (0-3) of each ingredient at all times.


Ingredient request
When the chef requests an ingredient, the kitchen helpers must provide it.

The first kitchen helper who has that ingredient gives the chef one piece.

If no kitchen helper has any, they yell "We're all out".


Knives
The restaurant provides good quality knife sets for cooks and chefs.

The knives are received some time after the employee is hired.

Cooks and chefs cannot cook without a knife.


The chef
Implement the role of the chef.

A kitchen has only one chef.

A kitchen cannot produce meals without a chef.


Unit tests
As an extra task, write unit tests for the different classes.

The cook class is covered with unit tests.

The chef class is covered with unit tests.

The kitchen helper class is covered with unit tests.

The kitchen class is covered with unit tests.


General requirements
There is a class UML representing the assignment. The UML is implemented. The code compiles. The UML contains the important parts. Containing every detail is not necessary. The implementation may diverge slightly from the original plan.
